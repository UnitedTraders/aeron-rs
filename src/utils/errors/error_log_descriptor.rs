/*
 * Distinct record of error observations. Rather than grow a record indefinitely when many errors of the same type
 * are logged, this log takes the approach of only recording distinct errors of the same type type and stack trace
 * and keeping a count and time of observation so that the record only grows with new distinct observations.
 *
 * The provided {@link AtomicBuffer} can wrap a memory-mapped file so logging can be out of process. This provides
 * the benefit that if a crash or lockup occurs then the log can be read externally without loss of data.
 *
 * This class is threadsafe to be used from multiple logging threads.
 *
 * The error records are recorded to the memory mapped buffer in the following format.
